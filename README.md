## Project introduction

Reading is problematic for the visually impaired: audiobooks and braille texts do not get published for many forms of texts, thus the problem that requires to be tackled is one that will make reading easier for the visually impaired. 

In Canada, there is approximately 836,000 people that are either legally blind or visually impaired in some manner [[1](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/blindness-and-vision-loss-emc)], and some 39 million legally blind individuals worldwide as well as up to 285 million people that have some sort of visual impairment [[2](https://www.who.int/blindness/publications/globaldata/en/#:~:text=Globally%20the%20number%20of%20people,are%2082%25%20of%20all%20blind)]. 

In the age of information, with information being more readily available than ever, it is important that those with vision problems can keep up with the others. Considering this, it was deemed important to create a product that would aid the blind or visually impaired have access to a wider selection of texts. The previous solution included a neural network accelerator that will be abandoned for saving costs.
